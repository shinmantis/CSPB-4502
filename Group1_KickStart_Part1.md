# Kickstarter
**Team Members:** Monica Boomgaarden, Rodrigo Garcia, Nicole Lincoln  

**Description:** We will be looking at a dataset of Kickstarter campaigns through 2019. We will be answering the question of which factors increase the likelihood of success of a Kickstarter campaign.   

**Prior Work:** There are Kaggle notebooks related to this dataset where people have   

**Datasets:**  

We will be using the "Kickstarter Projects" dataset. This data is supplied by Mickaël Mouillé, who used a twitter bot to gather the information for the dataset. The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects. The dataset is downloaded on each of our computers. It can also be found on Kaggle, which will allow us to work directly through the Kaggle notebooks, without having to download it directly to a machine.   

**Proposed Work:**  

- For cleaning and preprocessing, we will need to carefully review the dataset for missing data, however, after a cursory review, the data is relatively complete, and not a lot of cleaning is necessary. Using some of the metadata provided from the database creator, we will likely be able to determine if there are any attributes that are not necessary for our data analysis. We will likely need to create some new attributes in order to accurately compare campaigns. We will also need to use binning for some of the monetary and date values.

**List of tools:** Python and related libraries (matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn etc), Tableau, and Jupyter/Kaggle Notebooks  

**Evaluation:** We can evaluate our results by determining whether there are any attributes from our dataset that show a positive correlation with the "state" attribute, which determines whether a campaign was successful or failed.

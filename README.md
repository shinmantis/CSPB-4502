## Kickstarter Campaigns: Success Factors and Analysis  
by Monica Boomgaarden, Rodrigo Garcia, and Nicole Lincoln

#### Project Description
Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that acts as the foundation and economic engine for millions of community inspired projects worldwide.  The ability to predict the success of a kickstarter campaign would help many projects raise the funds they need to make their ideas become reality.  In our analysis, we explored the work performed by other data scientists and attempted to develop our own Logistic Regression model, using python and open-source libraries, in an effort to identify an attribute or combination of attributes that can strongly predict a campaign’s success.

#### Summary of Questions and Answers 

With our analysis we explore the questions: Can attributes be identified which impact the outcome of a Kickstarter campaign?  If so, which factors contribute most to the success of a Kickstarter project’s success or failure? 

Our model showed that the biggest predictor of the success of a kickstarter was the size of the fundraising goal. We also found that the main category of a kickstarter was an important feature, and the model indicated the "Dance" was the category that was most likely to be successful. 


#### Application 
Based on our model and EDA the two things that have the biggest impact on success are goal setting and getting backers. The takeaway from this is that when setting up a kickstarter the user should select the lowest goal possible that still meets their funding needs. Choosing the lowest goal makes sense because it has a higher success rate and kickstarter’s that meet their goals typically exceed them so it is likely even more money will be raised. Selecting a higher goal has a higher chance of failure and the kickstarter risks receiving no funding. Additionally, most pledges are small with a range of approximately $10 to $120 so attracting a high number of backers appears to be a key factor in the success of a Kickstarter campaign. 

Lastly, category, months, and duration did not seem to significantly impact the outcome of a Kickstarter. Thus, when creating a Kickstarter campaign users should feel relatively confident picking any category, launch month, or duration.
